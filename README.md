# Federated Learning Playground

This repository serves as a lightweight playground for exploring ideas in federated learning.  
The goal of this repo is to provide a flexible environment for quick iteration, testing concepts, and evaluating federated learning algorithms in practice.

More detailed documentation and structured experiments will be added over time.
